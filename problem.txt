Develop a RESTful API for a simple e-commerce application using Node.js and MySQL. This API should manage products, categories, and user authentication.

Technical Requirements:

Node.js:
Utilize a modern version of Node.js (preferably LTS).
Employ a well-structured project using a module bundler (e.g., Webpack) for organization.
Implement routing with a framework like Express.js.
MySQL:
Create a MySQL database with tables for products, categories, users (including authentication details), and potentially an association table to link products and categories.
Utilize a well-regarded Node.js MySQL driver (e.g., mysql2) for interaction with the database.
Adhere to best practices for prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
RESTful API:
Design a clear and consistent API endpoint structure, adhering to RESTful principles:
GET /products: Retrieve a list of all products.
GET /products/:id: Get a specific product by its ID.
POST /products: Create a new product.
PUT /products/:id: Update an existing product.
DELETE /products/:id: Delete a product. (Consider security implications)
Similar endpoints for categories (/categories).
Implement appropriate authentication mechanisms for user endpoints (e.g., JWT, session-based).
Include user registration, login, and profile management endpoints.
Return JSON data in a well-formatted manner for responses.
Handle errors gracefully, providing informative error messages with appropriate HTTP status codes.
Security:
Sanitize user input to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
Consider validating user input to enforce data integrity and prevent unexpected behavior.
Implement secure password hashing with a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
Additional Considerations:

Testing:
Write unit tests for your API endpoints to ensure proper functionality (consider using a testing framework like Jest or Mocha).
Documentation:
Provide clear documentation for the API, including endpoint descriptions, request/response examples, and authentication requirements. Swagger or OpenAPI specifications can be helpful for this.
Deployment:
Briefly outline how you would deploy the application to a production environment (e.g., Heroku, AWS).
Evaluation Criteria:

The following aspects will be considered during the interview:

Code Quality:
Clear and concise code structure.
Adherence to best practices and coding style guidelines (e.g., airbnb, standardjs).
Effective use of comments to explain logic and non-trivial code sections.
Database Design and Management:
Well-structured relational database schema with appropriate data types and constraints.
Secure database interactions using prepared statements.
RESTful API Design:
Adherence to RESTful principles and consistency in endpoint structure.
Clear and comprehensive documentation for the API.
Error Handling and Validation:
Robust error handling mechanisms returning informative error messages with relevant HTTP status codes.
Implementation of input validation to prevent unexpected behavior.
Security:
Measures taken to prevent XSS vulnerabilities, SQL injection, and insecure password storage.
Testing:
Presence of unit tests demonstrating functionality and coverage of critical API endpoints.
Deployment Considerations:
Understanding of how the application would be deployed to a production environment.
Deliverables:

A well-structured Node.js project containing your API implementation.
A MySQL database schema and associated SQL scripts.
Documentation for the API, ideally using a tool like Swagger or OpenAPI.
A brief README file explaining project setup, dependencies, and usage instructions.
Optional Enhancements (to showcase advanced skills):

Implement user roles and permissions for managing user access to certain API endpoints.
Use a database migration tool (e.g., Sequelize or knex) to manage database schema changes.
Integrate unit and integration testing frameworks for comprehensive testing.
Implement error logging and monitoring for production environments.
Consider caching mechanisms to improve API performance.
